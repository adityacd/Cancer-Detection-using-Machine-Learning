### I have done this project for practicing my Machine learning understanding and concepts.
### Cancer Detection using Machine Learning models. 
### I used three ML Models for this project.

* [Logistic Regression](https://towardsdatascience.com/logistic-regression-detailed-overview-46c4da4303bc)
* [Decision Tree Classifier](https://towardsdatascience.com/decision-tree-classification-de64fc4d5aac)
* [Random Forest Classifier](https://towardsdatascience.com/random-forest-classification-and-its-implementation-d5d840dbead0)

The Logistic Regression has the better testing accuracy compared to the other models that I have used.

ML Model | Accuracy
------------ | -------------
Logistic Regression | 97.90%
Decision Tree Classifier| 94.40%
Random Forest Classifier | 93.00%
