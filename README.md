### I have done this project for practicing my Machine learning understanding and concepts.
### Cancer Detection using Machine Learning models. 
### I used three ML Models for this project.

* Logistic Regression
* Decision Tree Classifier
* Random Forest Classifier

The Logistic Regression has the better testing accuracy compared to the other models that I have used.

ML Model | Accuracy
------------ | -------------
Logistic Regression | 97.90%
Decision Tree Classifier| 94.40%
Random Forest Classifier | 93.00%
